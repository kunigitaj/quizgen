Keep it self-contained and brief:\n\nSAP Business Application Studio\nBefore we get started developing data models in SAP HANA Cloud, we should introduce the key tool we will use, SAP Business Application Studio.\n\nSAP Business Application Studio is a very powerful, web-based Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that is used to develop all components of a modern, full-stack application including the interface, the application and the database layer.\n\nSAP Business Application Studio supports development of cloud, on-premise and hybrid applications that integrate SAP and non-SAP technologies.\n\nSAP Business Application Studio is probably the only development tool that you will ever need as it includes a huge number of features to support many development scenarios. One of those scenarios is data modeling in SAP HANA Cloud. This is the scenario we focus on in this learning journey.\n\nA screenshot of SAP Business Application Studio, showing the Action bar, the Explorer Pane, and the Welcome tab with the some of the key startup actions.\nSAP Business Application Studio is based on Visual Studio Code, which is an open-source software project started by Microsoft. It is widely adopted by the development community and is popular choice for developers because it allows them to plug-in their favorite extensions that provide additional tooling for their development projects. SAP and third parties provide many plug-ins for different types of SAP development projects to increase developer productivity.\n\nSAP Business Application Studio provides text and graphical editors to create development artifacts, plus a command line interface (CLI).\n\nA key feature of SAP Business Application Studio is the native Git support for source file version management. Git controls are embedded into the Business Application Studio.\n\nNote\n\nWeb IDE for SAP HANA can also be used for modeling in SAP HANA Cloud, but is not recommended as it misses many additional productivity aids and features that supports the modeler. Web IDE will not be developed further and Business Application Studio will be the tool that receives all new features. SAP Business Application Studio is the recommended tool for data modeling in SAP HANA Cloud.\n\nGetting Access to SAP Business Application Studio\nSAP Business Application Studio is provided as a web-based application, with the back-end running on SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). You subscribe to SAP Business Application Studio service at the BTP sub-account level. You do this in the BTP Cockpit.\n\nBefore you can launch SAP Business Application Studio from your browser, the following steps are required. Some relate to the BTP account or sub-account, others are specific to the user that will use SAP Business Application Studio.\n\nA table showing the required steps in SAP BTP before you can work in SAP Business Application Studio. The steps are separated beetween BTP Account and Subaccount step, and User Membership and authorization setup.\nWhen these steps are complete, you are ready to launch SAP Business Application Studio.\n\nWatch this video to learn about steps to launch SAP Business Application Studio.\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_object"}, "verbosity": "medium"}, "max_output_tokens": 1100, "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"}}}

Keep it self-contained and brief:\n\nDevelopment Spaces in SAP Business Application Studio\nIn SAP Business Application Studio, each developer has their own environment. This environment is made up of one or more Development Spaces.\n\nBe careful not to confuse development spaces with Cloud Foundry spaces.\nWhen you create a development space, you will be asked to choose tools, known as extensions, that you require. For modeling in SAP HANA Cloud, it is essential that you include the SAP HANA Calculation View Editor extension in your development space. This is a key tool that you will use.\n\nWatch the video, Configuring a Development Space, following this figure to learn about configuring a Development Space and choosing extensions.\n\nManaging Development Spaces\nThe landing page of SAP Business Application Studio contains the list of Development Spaces. You may have access to more than one. This list Includes the following:\n\nThe name of the Development Space\nThe kind of application\nThe status: STOPPED, STARTING, RUNNING, and so forth\nCreation date\nID\nA Development Space must be running before you can work in it. You start it up from the landing page. When it is running, the name of the Development Space \"becomes\" a hyperlink that you use to enter your Development Space.\n\nCaution\n\nAny Development Space automatically stops, after some idle time, to preserve resources. Therefore, be sure to always check the status of a development space in the landing page before connecting to that space. This is especially true if you bookmark the URL of a development space, which includes the space ID.\nCreating Several Development Spaces\nA diagram showing three different development spaces of different kinds created by a user. Two of them are running, the other one is stopped.\nDepending on the SAP BTP subscription, there might be some limitations to the maximum number of spaces that you can create, and the maximum number of spaces that can be running in parallel.\n\nNote\n\nIn an SAP BTP Trial account, you can define up to two Development Spaces and only one of these can be running at one time. If you need to swap development spaces, you must first stop the one you are using.\nMaintenance of Development Spaces\nWhen a Development Space is created, its name and kind of application cannot be changed. However, you can add optional extensions to the development space. Before you can do that, the Development Space must be stopped.\n\nCaution\n\nTo preserve the existing projects of your development space, it is not possible to remove an extension that is already assigned to it.\nIt is also possible to export the entire content of a Development Space as a compressed .tar.gz archive. Before you can do that, the Development Space must be running.\n\nAt the end of the Development Space export, you are given detailed information on how to import the Development Space content into another one. Generally, the target Development Space should be an empty one.\n\nCreate a Development Space\nLearn how to create a development space.\n\nDemo\n"}], "text": {"format": {"type": "json_object"}, "verbosity": "medium"}, "max_output_tokens": 1100, "reasoning": {"effort": "medium"}}}
