You can combine multiple data sources, define filters, calculate additional attributes, and create hierarchies to provide a meaningful view of master data. A dimension calculation view is a highly-reusable, centralized object that provides consistent data. You would typically define a dimension calculation view and share it with other colleagues who would consume it in their own calculation views.\\n\\nAn example of a dimension view for customer that accesses columns from different database tables. ID, Name, and Country are accessed from the Customer Table. Contact Frequency is accessed from the Contact Preference Table.\\nDimension calculation views are only built from attributes. They do not include measures. Every column from the data source is treated as an attribute. This means that any numerical column in the source record, such as price or salary, is treated as an attribute and not a measure. This means when you query a dimension calculation view, a complete list of every single individual value in the source is produced in the output. Even the numerical values such as quantities are listed individually and not aggregated. If you want to sum values then you need a cube calculation view where it is possible to define measures.\"}, {\"index\": 6, \"text\": \"Creating Cube Calculation Views\\nObjective\\n\\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to create a cube calculation view using the graphical calculation view editor.\\nCube Calculation Views\\nWhen you would like to create a calculation view that includes measures, you use a calculation view of the following type: cube.\\n\\nAn example of a cube calculation view for orders that accesses columns from different database tables. Order ID, Customer ID, and Quantity Sold are accessed from the Sales Table. Quantity Returned is accessed from the Returns Table.\\nBy default, all the measures in this type of calculation view will always be aggregated by the attributes requested by the query. Consequently, even though the calculation view may be able to provide many attributes, the measures are always automatically aggregated only by the attributes that were requested by the query.\\n\"}, {\"index\": 7, \"text\": \"Creating Time-Based Dimension Calculation Views\\nObjective\\n\\nAfter completing this lesson, you will be able to create a time-based dimension calculation view using the graphical calculation view editor.\\nTime-Based Dimension Calculation Views\\nThere are two types of dimension calculation view: Standard and Time.\\n\\nYou use time-based dimension calculation views to automatically generate various date-related attributes from a base date.

In this node, you assign semantics to each column in order to define its behavior and meaning. This is important information used by consuming clients so that they are able to display and process the columns appropriately.\\n\\nScreen capture of details of the Semantics node of a calculation view. As Semantics, you can specify that a field is Quantity with Unit Of Measure or Amount with Currency Code or Date.
